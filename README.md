### Unity Pathfinding demo for graduation thesis

[Link to written thesis on Theseus (In Finnish)](https://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi:amk-2021120724142)

This is a project I made as a demonstration while writing my thesis on pathfinding algorithms in Unity.

The application can step through and show how different heuristics can affect pathfinding, and generate random terrain for the algorithm to go through.
